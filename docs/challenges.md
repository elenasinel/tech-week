# **Challenges**

Each team shall shape their project around one of the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

1. UN SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. 

2. UN SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

3. UN SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being 

4. UN SDG 13: Climate Action

5. UN SDG 4: Education

## **Challenge 1:** 

**Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls** 

_The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #5_

Women and girls continue to suffer discrimination and violence in every part of the world. Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but it’s a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. 

How can we harness technology like AI to make online spaces safer for girls and women to be part of and easier for them to be heard? How can we harness AI to improve opportunities for girls across the world?

## **Challenge 2:** 

**Reduced Inequalities**

_The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #10_

There’s a significant gap between those who can participate in the digital ecosystem and those who cannot. It’s both a geographic gap between countries and a demographic gap between different groups within the same country. On a global level, the ability to participate in the digital economy is a differentiator between successful and less successful countries. In wealthier countries, it’s a differentiator between socio-economic groups: the internet is increasingly essential to access and manage finance, benefits, utilities, and maintain social networks; yet the elderly, poor and marginalised often find themselves excluded. 

How can AI be used to improve access to the digital realm? How could it enable those without an existing digital footprint to function online? How could it narrow the gap between wealthy and poor countries?

## **Challenge 3:** 

**Good Health and Well-being**

_The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #3_

The amount of time teenagers and adults are spending online is increasing. More and more time is being spent watching videos, chatting online, shopping, playing games, and staying connected with the internet. While many of the experiences people have online are positive, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that there is a fine line between time spent online and time well spent. It can be difficult to know what the fine line should be for each person as an individual.

How can we harness AI to help determine if the time spent online is time well spent? Consider the actual time spent on websites and apps in addition to how it may make someone feel. Does it help achieve a person’s goal or target? Does it increase a person’s overall well-being and happiness?

## **Challenge 4:** 

**Climate Action**

_The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #13_

Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It’s disrupting national economies, affecting lives, and costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is likely to increase by over 3°F this century. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.

How can AI help us tackle climate change?

## **Challenge 5:** 

**Education**

_The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #4_

Work is changing and the future of work is on the minds of policy-makers, employers and employees alike. However, the question of the future of education receives much less attention and change is slow.

In particular, the low take up of STEM subjects by girls weakens future innovation capability and retains gender pay gaps. According to the UNESCO groundbreaking report Cracking the code: Girls’ and women’s education in STEM, only 35% of STEM students in higher education globally are women, and differences are observed within STEM disciplines. For example, only 3% of female students in higher education choose information and communication technologies (ICT) studies. This is alarming, especially as STEM careers are often referred to as the jobs of the future, driving innovation, social wellbeing, inclusive growth and sustainable development. 

How could we use AI to enhance educational opportunities and better prepare girls for the jobs of the future?

## **Tools We Use:**

* Github.com
* Marvelapp.com, proto.io, sketch 
* Project Management: Github, Trello.com, Asana

## **By the end of Day 1 all teams should:**

* Choose one challenge to tackle
* Identify scope of the project
* Create a name of the project
* Research the problem at stake by using third- and first-party research (online & user interviews/surveys)
* Determine the tools and languages you will use
* Start working on creating an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) either using prototyping tools (like Marvelapp.com or similar ones) or code (ideally open-source on Github.com)
* Ensure you use office.com for collaboration on documents, forms, presentations, etc.
* Learn how to use Microsoft Azure by utilising an Azure pass provided for each table (activate using https://www.microsoftazurepass.com link)
