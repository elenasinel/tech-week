# About Us

Teens In AI is an Acorn Aspirations initiative and was launched at the UN AI for Good Global Summit in May 2018. It exists to increase diversity and inclusion in artificial intelligence. We aim to democratise AI and create opportunities for underrepresented talent through a combination of expert mentoring, talks, workshops, hackathons, bootcamps and accelerators, company tours and networking opportunities that give young people aged 12-18 early exposure to AI for social good. Our vision is for AI to be developed by a diverse group of thinkers and doers advancing AI for humanityâ€™s benefit.
