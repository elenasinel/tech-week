# **FAQs for Educators:**

## **What is a Hackathon?**

Traditionally, hackathons are technology development marathons that draw on the talents and initiative  of bright-minded volunteers –such as software developers, engineers, technologists, designers,
 scientists, and anyone with a passion and desire to have an immediate impact on the world.

Hackathons are open to anyone, and are focused on developing real solutions to global challenges by
 the end of the event.

Teens in AI Hack is a pilot project run over 2 weeks in partnership with Founders4Schools and CogX. It aims to
 inspire young people ages 11-18 into artificial intelligence and offer a chance to solve problems
 affecting humanity. At Teens in AI hackathons, young people lead the process and are guided by
 mentors to solve problems.

## **How do I enter a team?**

1. Create teams of 2-4 students - max 3 teams per school
2. Host an event 10-24 May and invite mentors
3. Submit videos by 5 pm 24 May on DevPost 
4. If your team is selected into 20 Finalist teams, it will be invited to CogX AI Festival for inspiration on Monday morning 10 June
5. Teams can return to school and carry on building their projects with or without the help of mentors
6. Teams will return to pitch live at Demo Day on 12 June 9 am at CogX

## **What kind of mentors do I need to invite?**

We have created comprehensive guides to guide you and mentors. If for whatever reason, you are unable to secure a mentor in specific expertise, **DON'T PANIC** - in our experience, teens are very resourceful and they will either Google or they will be bold enough to use LinkedIn, find a relevant mentor, connect with them and ask for help and take it to Twitter!

**Tech Mentors** - Full stack developers are great, but if they have expertise in Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence, it would be a bonus (1 or 2, ideally)

**Design Thinkers** - one design thinker will be sufficient (Please see relevant guide in Hackathon Guide section on Human-Centred Design/Design Thinking)

**Entrepreneur/Business Coach -**  someone to inspire and demystify business models

**Ethicists -** please see the guide on Ethics in AI. Ideally, everyone who learns to code should understand some basics of ethics and why it's important to code "responsibly"
