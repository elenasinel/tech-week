**1. Submitting**

1.1 DevPost is the Official Teens in AI competition submission site and allows you to submit all components required for your team’s entry. Note: submission elements and times are system controlled so no extensions are available!

1.2 Register all team members (including teacher & mentors) in DevPost (you'll need at least one person registered in DevPost to create and submit your project page).

1.3 Teams are required to submit the following as part of their competition entry on DevPost:

1.3.1 A descriptive project page in DevPost, listing your team members, with details about your project.

1.3.2 **A Business Model Canvas** (BMC) that lays out the elements of how your business idea and app could be brought to reality. When you are finished you'll have to upload an image of your canvas somewhere it can be accessed by our judges, (e.g. Google Docs, OneDrive, DropBox), and link to it from your DevPost project page.

1.3.3 **A Software Application**. This can be anything, e.g. a website, a mobile app, a game. You'll need to host your app somewhere that it can be viewed or download by our judges, and link to it from your DevPost project page. We suggest you use one of the many free or trial services available from the likes of Google, Azure, OpenShift, Heroku, GitHub, etc. (NB: Teens in AI does not provide any app hosting facilities.) Tip: your team should familiarise themselves with your hosting platform before the competition weekend.

1.3.4 **A Pitch Video** (maximum three minutes) that explains your Business Model Canvas and demos your app. You'll need to shoot and edit your video using your own equipment – laptop and phone camera quality will be fine. You'll also need to upload your video to YouTube (or similar) for our judges to view, and link to it from your DevPost project page. Remember that the judging panel is viewing the videos in isolation and doesn’t necessarily have any context around your project. You may mix in other elements with the screen-cast, such as footage demonstrating the issues your projects addresses, interviews, live action material you’ve filmed, et cetera – but be aware that videos that don’t focus on showing off the project itself will not be as valued as ones that do. Check out the hacker toolkit for some assistance and instruction on how to make a compelling video. 

1.3.5 **Outcomes** from the project itself (any code, graphics, mashups, applications, website URLs, photos of each stage to create your artistic representation etc.). If judges are able to see and play with it that is useful, but this is a minor component of the judging. Teams can put the code/source on GitHub, Bitbucket, Sourceforge or an equivalent repository system and must make the URL available on their project page for verification. For artistic works you may need to create a photo library or share a link to a Googledocs or similar that contains evidence of the stages of your project.

**2. General**

2.1 Each winning team must nominate a teacher to liaise with and provide their details to Teens in AI organisers following prize announcements to coordinate distribution of prizes after the event. 

2.2 Judges expect entries to be primarily developed throughout the 10-24 May. If submissions are shown to have been worked on before then, the submission will be ineligible for prizes. This does not include reuse or extension of existing software, libraries or data sets. 

2.3 The maximum team size is 4.

2.4 No judges will be eligible to compete for prizes, and individuals from organisations or companies are also not eligible for prizes sponsored by their organisation. Judges reserve the right to disqualify a mentor/speaker if they perceive unfairness.

2.5 Don’t do bad things. Please participate in and engage with the contest in that spirit and in good faith. You must not include submissions that are:

2.5.1 potentially libellous, false, defamatory, privacy invasive or overtly political;

2.5.2 material which is potentially confidential, commercially sensitive, or which would cause personal distress or loss;

2.11 Submissions and comments will be posted live, but occasionally they may not make it through our anti-trolling and anti-spamming filters and may need to be moderated manually. We reserve the right to remove or not post any submission that reasonably appears to breach any of these rules.

2.12 Teens in AI makes no representations or warranties of any kind, expressed or implied, including warranties of accuracy, in regard to any submissions or links published on the Teens in AI website.
