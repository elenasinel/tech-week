## What is a Hackathon?

Traditionally, hackathons are technology development marathons that draw on the talents and initiative of bright-minded volunteers – such as software developers, engineers, technologists, designers, scientists, and anyone with a passion and desire to have an immediate impact on the world. Hackathons are open to anyone, and are focused on developing real solutions to global challenges by the end of the event. Teens in AI Hack is a pilot project run in partnership with Founders4Schools and CognitionX. It aims to inspire young people ages 11-18 into artificial intelligence and offer a chance to solve problems affecting humanity. At Teens in AI hackathons, young people lead the process and are guided by mentors to solve problems. 

## What should I bring to the hackathon?

We don't provide computers, so please make sure you bring a laptop with.

## Do young people need to know how to code?

No prior coding skills needed. If you are a beginner in Python, that's great! Do not worry - we will teach you all the essentials. Trust your mentors - they will guide you through the entire process!

## What will young people be learning?
